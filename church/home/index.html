    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>The Church of South India (CSI) is a united Protestant Church in India. It is the 
        result of union of a number of Protestant denominations in South India
         that occurred after the independence of India.
          The birth of the CSI on Saturday September 27, 1947 
          should have taken place in the St. George's Cathedral 
          Madras, for it was from here that the initiative in 
          this direction and to this end, was taken and pressed
           forward.Thus it was that the Anglican Diocese of
            Madras in the Church of South India, with Bishop 
            Hollis it first CSI Bishop.The new CSI Diocese of
            Madras was a compact area comprising the city of 
            Madras, Nellore, chinglepet, North and South Arcot 
            and the Tamil speaking areas of Chitoor district. 
            It had some 80,000 members, with 120 presbyters. 
            It was second only to the Diocese of tinnevell in 
            staff and membership. But the fact that this was 
            Diocese which had inherited congregations from all 
            the uniting traditions made it the all neighbouring 
            eyes to see how the Union was going to be manifested 
            in Unity</p>

         <h1>History</h1>
         <h2>Origin</h2>
         <p>Four different church traditions were brought together in the CSI:
             Anglican, Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist. All these churches had been
              established in India through the missionary work of churches in
               Europe, America, and Australia, which had started their work in India at 
               different periods from the beginning of the 18th century.</p>
